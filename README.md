# Signature Forgery Detection

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting forged signatures using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** implemented in **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. Signatures play a crucial role in identity verification, legal authentication, and financial transactions. Traditional methods of manual verification are prone to errors and inefficiencies.

Our system leverages deep learning to automatically distinguish between genuine and forged signatures. A **Tkinter-based GUI** is included, making the tool user-friendly and accessible.

## 🚀 Features

* **Deep Learning Model:** Custom CNN optimized for detecting signature forgeries.
* **Benchmarking:** Performance compared against VGG16 and ResNet50.
* **Accuracy:** Achieves **92%–98%** detection accuracy with custom CNN.
* **GUI Support:** Upload signatures through a Tkinter interface for instant classification.
* **Real-Time Processing:** Quick predictions for practical use.
* **Cost-Effective & Scalable:** Lightweight design suitable for educational institutions and small organizations.

3. **Train the Model (Optional):**

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. **Run the GUI:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Upload Signature:**

   * Use the **Upload Signature** button.
   * The system predicts **Genuine** or **Forged**.
